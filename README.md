I have created an interactive excel dashboard using data about Online Influencer Marketing. I got a clean dataset  from data.world and not much of cleaning was needed. Only quantitative data(no of voters) was available. Link here - https://data.world/ahalps/online-influencer-marketing. I have used few formulas like Averageif, nestedif, sumif and xlookup for analysis purpose. Insights inferred: 1. Most of the voters were influenced by "Friend", followed by "Funny meme posters", 2. Of those who have been influenced by "Celebrities" has got the lowest votes. 3. Female voters were lnfluenced less while the male voters were influenced more by "Funny mem posters".
